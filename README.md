# 💫 About Me:
I'm Shreyans, a junior at Duke double majoring in Statistics and Mathematics. I am a data scientist interested in sports, social good, and entrepreneurship. 
<br><br>
In my free time, I weightlift (MyFitnessPal streak of 242), memorize NBA statistics (I can go on and on), and enjoy board games and cooking.

<br><br>Here is my cool journey with numbers:
<br>Age 10: Could multiply up to 6 digit numbers with 6 digit numbers in < 5 seconds mentally.
<br>Age 13: Could solve the Rubik's Cube in under 10 seconds. 
<br>Age 17: Founded a UN-recognized STEM learning organization impacting 25000+ in 25+ countries. 
<br>Age 18: Authored a top 175 Education Best-sellers math book.
<br>Age 18: Represented Team India at the South East Asian Mathematical Olympiad.

<br><br>My cliche math ending from my accepted essay at Duke:<br>"I find numbers nurturing me through unconventional lenses. I realize that the limits to mathematics are infinite. So I explore"
